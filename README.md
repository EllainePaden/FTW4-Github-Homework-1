# FTW4-Github-Homework-1
Hi I am Ben Ellaine D. Paden, your future marvelous Data Scientist. And from this day onward will do her best to submit cool things in here (Hahaha Cross fingers). I love travelling and to spend time with family and friends. I like reading books, watching tv series and listening to music. I hope someday I'll be able to provide a good life for my family and achieve my goals before I officially turned into Tita =)). I wish someday my skills would also be used to contribute to the society.
